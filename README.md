Ethical hacking, vulnerability research and exploit understanding environment.

Jeopardy 'Capture The Flag' format:
  When a challange solved, the user is given a key (tied to their username) they
  can submit to a score-bot for points!

The aim of this project is to teach vulnerability research and exploit
understanding in a fun, safe environment.

_“To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.”_
― Sun Tzu, The Art of War

The best security mitigations, patches and secure code come from security
professionals with a deep understanding of security flaws and the way exploits
work; this environment is designed to give students that understanding.
