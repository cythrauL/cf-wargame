FORMAT:

This folder contais sub folders, who's names relate to the challenges.

This folder only needs to be included if the wargame is being played without a web front-end, as that should be used to host solutions and patches, otherwise.

When you complete a challenge, go into the corresponding folder and create a new sub folder, named after yourself (or some unique alias) and fill it with whatever you like!

I'd recommend:

A proof of concept
An explenation of why it works
A patch

Good Luck!
